# Workout tracker

Please read the current release of the project as it is highly unstable and is currently in
development.

This workout tracker is a PWA that operates fully client side and is built using NextJS and IndexedDB for data storage.
It allows users to track their workouts, view their progress, and manage sets and exercises withing the browser with no external services.

## Features

- Client side storage, meaning the app is offline capable.
  
- If a user wants to switch devices they can download their data, and then reupload it back onto the app seamlessly.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute fork the repository and submit a pull request; there is lots of work to be done.
